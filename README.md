# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine (SVM)

# Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a pregnant woman has diabetes based on the provided features. The key steps involved in this project include:

- Data preprocessing and feature scaling.
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training the SVM model on the training data.
- Evaluating the model's performance using accuracy scores.

## Dataset

The dataset contains various features relevant to predicting diabetes among pregnant women. You can download it from Kaggle.

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn` (for `StandardScaler`, `train_test_split`, `SVM`, and `accuracy_score`)
